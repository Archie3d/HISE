# Commit Syntax

- commits that should show up in the changelog must have three asterisks at the beginning: `***`
- commits that refer to an issue must have this syntax: `fixed issue #124`
- commits that are purely internal (refactoring, folder restructuring) should have a `@internal` at the beginning.
